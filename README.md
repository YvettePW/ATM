This exercise simulates a simple ATM deposit and withdrawal.<br></br>
To run this on your machine, download these files, navigate on a terminal to the folder they are in, type http-server or http-server -c-1, go to localhost:8080 on your browser, and select standalone.html.<br></br>
Additional functionality that would be helpful to a user for future iterations would be to add bootstrap styling.<br></br>
